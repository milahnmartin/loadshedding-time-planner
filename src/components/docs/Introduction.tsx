        What is LS PLANNER? LS PLANNER is a tool that makes it simple and easy to schedule
        meetings and gaming sessions around loadshedding. How does it work? Users set
        their loadshedding location. LS PLANNER then automatically tracks their
        loadshedding schedule through an API. The user then creates a "plan" where they
        can choose a date, start and end time and invite other users or teams to their
        plan. Other users then accept the invite and get added to the "plan". LS PLANNER
        then compares all the users on the "plan's" loadshedding times and then shows all
        available times where nobody on the "plan" has loadshedding in the chosen
        timeframe.
